# Resizer
Resize, move and modify an application window.

## Function
This program lets you select an application or window and will do the following:
- Resize to 2560x1440
- Position the window at x:1760 y:0
- Remove the titlebar
- Set the application to "always on top"

"Always on top" can be toggled with the hotkey "CTRL+ALT+T".

Default settings are intended for a screen layout of **[ 1760 | 2560 | 800 ]** on a _5160x1440_ monitor.

The settings are adjustable in the script.

## Purpose
The purpose is to imitate "fullscreen windowed" mode for use on an ultrawide monitor (32:9) with custom layout.

This removes the need to use 2 inputs as well as adds more possible layouts.
